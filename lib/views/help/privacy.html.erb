    WhatDoTheyKnow is run by mySociety, a project of the charity UK Citizens
    Online Democracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    For full details of mySociety's structure, governance, and details of the
    relevant registrations with the Information Commissioner and The Charity

  <p>
    Working in the fields of transparency and accountability, mySociety
    thinks hard and cares very much about the privacy and security of our users:
    the length of this privacy policy is one result of that. We know that no-one
    goes through privacy policies for fun, though, so we’ve tried to keep it a
    clear and reasonably quick read.

  <p>
    In using WhatDoTheyKnow to send an FOI request, you are providing us with
    the following personal information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Your email address</li>
    <li>Your IP address</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some of this information is passed on to the public authority who receive
    your request, and is published on the website. This page explains:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>what we do with each type of information</li>
    <li>who sees it</li>
    <li>how it is used</li>

    central mailbox, which they must access with adherence to our strict
    security protocols.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with any other email, this results in us holding your

    When you submit an FOI request through WhatDoTheyKnow, your name (or the
    <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/privacy#real_name">name you are
    making your request under</a>) is:
  </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>sent to the public authority, and</li>
    <li>published on the website along with the request.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    See <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/privacy#public_request">
    this section</a> for more information on why this is the case.
  </p>

  <h3 id="email_address">
    Your email address
    <a href="#email_address">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Your email address is not shared with the public authority, nor is it
    published on the website. WhatDoTheyKnow automatically generates a
    @whatdotheyknow.com email address specific to each request — your message
    will have this address in the ‘from’ line and it’s also the address that
    responses are sent to.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the public authority replies via this custom email address, their
    response is published on your request’s page on WhatDoTheyKnow.com. At the
    same time, our system alerts you, by sending a message to the personal email
    address you have provided when creating your request, to let you know there
    is a response: this too is an automated process.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, your email address is largely kept private. There are two exceptions to
    this. Firstly, site administrators may access your email address in the
    process of administering the site, and may use your email address to contact
    you about your use of the site. We also occasionally contact users who have
    made a particularly interesting request, as we like to write about these on
    the mySociety blog.
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, if you send a message to another user on the site, your email
    address is shared with them. You’ll see an alert to warn you of this before
    you submit your message.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not disclose your email address to anyone else unless we are obliged
    to by law, or you ask us to.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Will your email address be used for any other purposes?
  </h4>
  <p>
    No. After you sign up to WhatDoTheyKnow we will only send you emails
    relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for,
    or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or
    sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law,
    or you ask us to.
  </p>
  <p>
    In theory, spam could be received via the ‘send this user an email’
    function. Abuse of this service is not common and you can report any
    messages which you consider inappropriate to us via the
    <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/contact">Contact Us</a> form.
    Upon consideration, we may suspend users who have abused this service.

  <h3 id="request">
    Your request
    <a href="#request">#</a>

  <p>
    Your request is sent to the public authority from whom you are requesting
    information. At the same time, it is published on this website where anyone
    can see it.
  </p>

  <h3 id="ip_address">
    Your IP address
    <a href="#ip_address">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The IP address associated with your use of the site (which may or may not be
    sufficient to identify you, depending on circumstances), is recorded
    automatically to our logs.  It will not normally be seen by anyone - see the
    <a href="#our_logging">section on our own logging</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not share IP addresses with anyone else unless required to by law (for
    example in the course of a police investigation for which a court order has
    been received).
  </p>

  <h3 id="full_address">
    Your postal address
    <a href="#full_address">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    You do not need to supply a postal address in order to make an FOI request.
    If a public authority asks you for your full, physical address, reply to
    them saying that section 8.1.b of the FOI Act asks for an "address for
    correspondence", and that the email address you are using is sufficient.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The Ministry of Justice has guidance on this&ndash;
      <em>“As well as hard copy written correspondence, requests that are
      transmitted electronically (for example, in emails) are acceptable
      ... If a request is received by email and no postal address is given,
      the email address should be treated as the return address.”
      </em>
    </li>
    <li>
     The Information Commissioner’s <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/freedom_of_information/guide/receiving_a_request">
      Hints for Practitioners</a> say <em>“A request must ...
      include an address for correspondence. This need not be the person’s
      residential or work address - it can be <strong>any address at which
      you can write to them</strong>, including a postal address or
      <strong>email address</strong>;”</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Paragraph 107 of the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1164/recognising-a-request-made-under-the-foia.pdf#page=22"
      title="Recognising a request made under the FOIA">Information
      Commissioner’s Guidance on recognising a request</a> under the Freedom
      of Information Act now contains a section specifically on
      <%= link_to 'WhatDoTheyKnow', frontpage_path %> which states:

      <blockquote>
        With respect to the address for correspondence, we consider the
        <code>@whatdotheyknow.com</code> email address provided to
        authorities when requests are made through the site to be a valid
        contact address for the purposes of Section 8(1)(b).
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="postal_answer">
    What to do if the authority asks for a postal address to send a paper
    response
    <a href="#postal_answer">#</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
    If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you
    want, they may ask you for a postal address. Naturally, since one of
    the principles of WhatDoTheyKnow is that, by sharing responses to FOI
    requests, we are providing resources for everyone to use, we prefer
    that they provide the information by email.
  </p>
  <p>
    So you might try persuading them to scan in the documents for you.
    You can even <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a
    scanner</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that doesn’t work, and you want to provide your postal address
    privately in order to receive the documents, mark your request as
    “They are going to reply by post”, and it will give you an email
    address to use for that purpose.
  </p>
  <h3 id="our_logging">
    Our own logging
    <a href="#our_logging">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    In addition to the information you give us about yourself in order to use
    the site (e.g. your name and email address), we collect and log some
    additional information in order to analyse and fix problems with the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our webserver logs maintain a history of page requests. This includes
    information about requests, including the client IP address, data submitted
    (which might include your email address when you log on to the site),
    request date and time, page requested, browser version and <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">referrer</a>. We routinely
    keep this information for 60 days. Note that in normal circumstances, this
    data is infrequently accessed by a human, and when it is, they are likely to
    be assessing it in bulk, in order to understand an issue with the site,
    rather than at a granular level of individual users.
  </p>

  <h3 id="research">
    Research
    <a href="#research">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    mySociety sometimes analyses data such as requests and responses from
    WhatDoTheyKnow for research. We adhere to strict internal privacy policies
    which mean that any personal data is kept secure. Data such as names and
    email addresses is excluded from the research datasets, and where possible
    redacted from the body of the text.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would also like to share non-personal data from WhatDoTheyKnow with
    external researchers and are currently working on a policy which will allow
    us to take precautions against the release of sensitive personal information
    in cases where such data has been released in error. These precautions
    include excluding certain file attachments that could contain unintended
    releases but have low research value (such as Excel XLS or CSV files); a
    delay of 3 months to give time for leaks to be detected; and maintaining a
    register of researchers who have access to the datasets. Data passed to
    third parties will never exceed what is publically available on the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it is complete, our Research Data Release policy will be available  on
    request.
  </p>

  <h3 id="encrypted_transfer">
    Encrypted Transfer of Data
    <a href="#encrypted_transfer">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes we will want to send a copy of sensitive material to the
    Information Commissioner to assist them with their investigation into a
    public body’s breach of the Data Protection Act or the General Data
    Protection Regulations. In the case of bulk sensitive personal information
    we do this by encrypting the data with an AES algorithm using at least a
    256bit key. The encrypted data will be sent by email or made available for
    download via the web, FTP or USB and the decryption password is provided via
    a separate channel.

  <h3 id="public_names">
    Why do users’ names and requests appear publicly on the site?
    <a href="#public_names">#</a>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Your name is an integral part of your request, so has to be published with
    it. It is only fair, as we are also going to publish the name of the civil
    servant who writes the response to your request. Using your real name also
    helps people get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to
    campaign with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    But perhaps most importantly, it means that our users think twice before
    making a request: if you know that your name will be permanently attached to
    it for all to see, then you are far more likely to make a responsible, valid
    and useful request.
  </p>
  <p>
    By law, you must use your real name for the request to be a valid Freedom of
    Information request — but see the next question for alternatives if you do
    not want to publish your full name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your requests will be grouped together and appear on your profile on the site.
  </p>

  <h3 id="real_name">
    Can FOI requests be made under a pseudonym?
    <a href="#real_name">#</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Technically, you must use your real name for your request to be a valid
    Freedom of Information request in law. See this <a
    href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1043418/consideration-of-the-identity-or-motives-of-the-applicant.pdf">
    guidance from the Information Commissioner</a>
    (October 2007). However, the same guidance also
    says it is good practice for the public authority to still consider a
    request made using an obvious pseudonym. You should refer to this if a
    public authority refuses a request because you used a pseudonym.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be aware, though, that even if the authority follows this good practice, the
    pseudonym will probably make it impossible for you to complain to the
    Information Commissioner later about the handling of your request.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several good alternatives to using a pseudonym.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use a different form of your name. The guidance says
      that “Mr Arthur Thomas Roberts” can make a valid request as “Arthur
      Roberts”, “A. T. Roberts”, or “Mr Roberts”, but <strong>not</strong> as
      “Arthur” or “A.T.R.”.
    </li>
    <li>
      Women may use their maiden name.
    </li>
    <li>
      In most cases, you may use any name by which you are “widely known and/or
      is regularly used”.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the name of an organisation, the name of a company, the trading name
      of a company, or the trading name of a sole trader.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask someone else to make the request on your behalf.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may, if you are really stuck, ask us to make the request on
      your behalf. Please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> with
      a good reason why you cannot make the request yourself and cannot
      ask a friend to. Do not impersonate someone else. This is an abuse of
      our terms of service - read more in our <a href="<%=
      help_house_rules_path %>">House Rules</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Historically, some public authorities used mySociety’s <a
    href="https://github.com/mysociety/foi-register">FOI Register</a>
    software (which has since been discontinued) in order to use
    WhatDoTheyKnow as a disclosure log for all their FOI activity. When
    people made requests to the authority their names were usually withheld
    from publication just as they would in an authority disclosure log on an
    authority website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, for various reasons including proven endangerment to the
    individual, we will remove a user’s name from the site; when we do so we
    make this clear; typically by replacing the name with “[name removed]”.

    <li>
      Your request appearing in results when your name is put into search engines.

      </p>
      <p>
        The page does not display details of alerts you have subscribed to,

    As detailed above, sending an FOI request through this site results in your

    our servers. Your email address is accessible only to site administrators.
    At the current time, the policy is to retain this information indefinitely.

    <strong>Sometimes public bodies accidentally release personal data in bulk.
    WhatDoTheyKnow does not want to hold this information longer than necessary
    and treats it with due care.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Volunteers will only download from
    WhatDoTheyKnow whatever information is necessary to handle a suspected
    breach of the data protection law by an authority, encrypting the data using
    a strong algorithm, protecting their device with a strong password, and
    deleting the data as soon as possible and in all circumstances within four
    hours. If the data needs to be retained after that period, it is kept on
    mySociety’s servers and mySociety is responsible for holding and deleting
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    For material that needs to be retained for a relatively short period e.g.
    where we give the ICO four weeks to request the material from us before we
    delete it, the material will remain hidden on WhatDoTheyKnow and will
    usually be deleted at the end of the retention period. In exceptional
    circumstances, such as where we are in correspondence with the ICO about the
    case, we may extend the retention period.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any, rare, case where a retention period over four weeks is deemed
    necessary and it is considered the release of the material is would pose a
    significant risk of harm, mySociety staff are responsible for moving the
    material to non-web accessible storage on mySociety’s servers and deleting
    it when the retention period is complete.

    such as in-progress police investigations or lawsuits, is retained
    separately. Misdirected mail of a sensitive nature, such as a request for

  <h2 id="legal_basis">
    Legal basis for processing
    <a href="#legal_basis">#</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    In most cases our legal basis for processing personal information is
    "legitimate interest" (this is as laid out in <a
    href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">6(1)(f)</a> – of the GDPR, in force
    from 25 May 2018). We believe that we are pursuing a legitimate interest in
    processing personal data to provide our service to benefit of our users and
    the benefit of society. There is a benefit to our users in that we offer an
    easy way to make, track and publish Freedom of Information requests. The
    service also has a benefit to the public as any information released in
    response to the request is publicly available in a historic archive for
    anyone to use. There is also a benefit to authorities responding to
    requests, in that the automatic publication of the requests reduces
    duplicate requesting.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that our processing of our users' data is as they would expect
    when they use our service. If you use WhatDoTheyKnow to make a FOI request,
    you are consenting to your data being processed as described on this page.
    We make clear how we handle users' data, and link to this page, at
    appropriate places within our service, including during the process of
    signing up, and making a request.
  </p>
  <p>
    On rare occasions the legal basis of "compliance with a legal obligation"
    will apply when we are legally obliged to hold material, for example where
    a court order has been issued (<a
    href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">6(1)(c)</a> of the GDPR).
  </p>
  <p>
    In almost all cases our processing of personal information will be lawful
    under Article 6 of the GDPR but we may also rely on <a
    href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/the-special-purposes/enacted"
    >the "special purposes" derogations in the Data Protection Act 2018</a>,
    especially those applying to academic and journalistic purposes. Often use
    of our service is academic or journalistic in nature, and the provision of
    our service as a whole may be considered a journalistic endeavour.

    and make use of the information that you have found. Even though you may not
    find the response to a request useful any more, it may be of interest to
    others, and may have been used to support research, news articles, lobbying
    or other activities. For this reason, we will not normally delete the
    substance of requests and responses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Names</strong> If you have made requests for information via our
    site and are
    considering asking us to remove your name, please do take a moment to
    reflect and reconsider. Typically Freedom of Information requests made via
    our service form a positive part of an individual’s online footprint; a
    public record of civic activism is something to be proud of.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, we understand that there can be good reasons why you may want us
    to remove your name and will make our best efforts to do so if you ask us
    to. Similarly, we may also remove other personal information. Note that if
    your name has been released as part of an authority’s response, we may not
    be able to remove it easily, however we will of course consider formal
    “right to be forgotten” / “right of erasure” requests and remove material if
    we are unable to justify continuing to hold and process it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re worried about your name being associated with your request,  and
    you’ve not made it yet, then  see our advice on using
    <a href="#real_name">pseudonyms</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Email addresses</strong> We also hold your email address. If you ask
    us to cease
    holding your email address while you are awaiting a response, we will not be
    able to notify you when a response does come in. For this reason we strongly
    advise keeping an active email address associated with your account while
    you have correspondence in progress. As a user you can change the email
    address associated with your account at any time yourself, or you can get in
    touch with us an ask us to remove your email address from your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other information we hold on users of our service is described under:
    <a href="#consequences_registering">“When registering with the site”</a> and
    <a href="#our_logging">“Our own logging”</a>.
    As a user you can view and edit much of this material yourself, but if you
    feel the need to ask us to delete material do get in touch.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Removal of personal information from requests and responses
  </h4>
  <p>
    If you see any personal information about you on the site which you’d like
    us to remove or hide, then please <a href="<%=
        help_contact_path %>">let us know</a>. Specify exactly what
    information you believe to be problematic and why, and let us know where it
    appears on the site.
  </p>
  <p>
     We will consider any such notice, and balance it against any public
     interest in publishing the material. There is some guidance about this <a
     href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/">on the ICO’s website</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    If it is sensitive personal information that has been accidentally posted,
    then we will usually remove it. Normally we will only consider requests to
    remove personal information which come from the individual concerned, but
    for sensitive information or large volumes of breached personal data we
    would appreciate being notified by anyone.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Removal of public servants’ personal information from responses
  </h4>
  <p>
     We
    automatically publish responses to requests made through the site in full.
    Where these responses include the personal information of public servants,
    we consider the legal basis for our processing of this information to be
    that we have a legitimate interest as described in
    <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article 6(1)(f)</a>
    of the GDPR). Our legitimate interest is in benefiting society by preserving and
    promoting transparency and openness, and the accountability of those in
    positions of power and in maintaining a historic public archive of Freedom of
    Information requests and responses.  We will consider requests to remove the
    names of public servants when it seems that the interests, rights and
    freedoms of the data subject outweigh the public interest in publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you are a decision-maker of any seniority, or if you are responding to an
      FOI request, we will not normally remove your details from documents and
      emails sent by a public body or from FOI requests. Accountability of
      decision-making is at the heart of good government.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you hold a junior, non-decision making post we will consider requests
      to remove your details. Removing these details is time-consuming for our
      volunteers, so please let us know why this really matters to you. If we
      are not required to act by law but agree to remove your details we will
      take reasonable steps to do so — but in some cases may not be able to as
      it can be difficult to remove material from some types of document, such
      as images and PDFs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are happy try to assist FOI officers who want us to help them remove
    their signatures from the website, but generally in such circumstances we
    require replacement responses to be prepared and sent to the requester
    before we will remove the original documents. We are generally unable to
    edit attachments which have been released via our service.

  <p>
    Like many other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics
    to help us make our websites better. These tools are very common and
    used by many other sites, but they do have privacy implications, and as
    a charity concerned with socially positive uses of the internet, we
    think it’s important to explain them in full. If you don’t want to share
    your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with other companies, you

  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <p>
    To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data
    files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; this is very
    common practice and most websites do this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies help our websites to, for example, remember that you have logged
    in so you don’t need to do that on every page, or to measure how people
    use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly.
    Below, we list the cookies and services that this site may use.

  <h4>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h4>
  <p>
    We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this
    site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to
    understand how we could do better. Google Analytics stores information
    such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got
    here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP
    addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information
    is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share
    our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics
    information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the
    same.

    If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you
    can install the <a
    href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">official browser plugin
    for blocking Google Analytics</a>.

  <p><strong>Measuring website performance (New Relic)</strong></p>
  <p>
    WhatDoTheyKnow uses New Relic to collect data on the performance of the
    site - how quickly it sends pages and how much memory and processing power
    it takes on the computers that run it. We do this to ensure that the site
    runs quickly and efficiently. New Relic stores information on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What pages are visited on the site, and how long they take to load.
    </li>
    <li>
      The structure, not the content, of database queries made in order to
      run the site and how long they take to run.
    </li>
    <li>
      Memory and CPU usage on the servers that run the site.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Sample data about database queries, individual requests for pages is
    stored by New Relic for 7 days, aggregate data is stored for a maximum
    of 90 days.
