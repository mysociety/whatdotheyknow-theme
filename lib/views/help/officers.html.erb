        Welcome! WhatDoTheyKnow is a free service that helps ordinary members of
        the public make FOI requests, and easily track and share the responses
        from public bodies like yourself in the UK. It is run by the charity
        UKCOD.
      </p>
      <p>
        WhatDoTheyKnow has processed over 430,000 FOI requests since its launch
        in 2008, and is the UK’s most widely-known FOI service. We also campaign
        for citizen’s rights to information and for the strengthening of FOI
        laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FOI request that has brought you here was made by someone using
        WhatDoTheyKnow. You can simply reply to the request as you would any
        other request from an individual. <strong>The only difference is that
        your response will be automatically published on the Internet.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have privacy or other concerns, please read the answers below.
        You might like to read the <a href="/help/about">introduction to
        WhatDoTheyKnow</a> to find out more about what the site does from the
        point of view of a user. You can also search the site to find the
        authority that you work for, and view the status of any requests made
        using the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we welcome comments and
        thoughts from FOI officers, please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">

        We think there are lots of benefits to doing so.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Most importantly it will encourage the public to be more interested
          and involved in the work of government.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also hope that it will reduce the number of duplicate requests on
          any subject that a public body will receive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those taking action following the release of material, such as
          lobbying elected representatives or writing articles, are able to cite
          the source of the information they are referring to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Given that Freedom of Information responses contain public
          information, which anybody could easily request again from the
          public authority, we think there should be no reason not to publish
          it widely.

        Yes. For the purposes of keeping track of responses we use
        computer-generated email addresses for each request. However, before
        they can send a request, each user must register on the site with a
        unique email address that we then verify. You can search this site and
        find a page listing all requests that each person has made.

            contact address for the purposes of Section 8(1)(b).

        WhatDoTheyKnow is not making any requests. We are sending requests on
        behalf of our users, who are real people making the requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at it like this - if lots of different people made requests from
        different Hotmail email addresses, then you would not think that Microsoft were
        making vexatious requests. It is exactly the same if lots of requests are made
        via WhatDoTheyKnow. Moreover, since all requests are public it is much easier
        for you to see if one of our users is making vexatious requests.

    <dd>
      <p>
        If a request appears on the site, then we have attempted to send it to
        the authority by email. You’ll see a <a
        href="https://www.mysociety.org/2016/07/29/the-small-symbol-that-tells-you-all-is-well/?utm_source=whatdotheyknow.com&utm_medium=link">
        small green tick</a> by those which have certifiably
        been received by the authority’s mail servers, and any delivery failure
        messages will automatically appear on the site. You can check the
        address we’re using with the “View FOI email address” link which appears
        on the page for the authority. <a href="/help/contact">Contact us</a> if
        there is a better address we can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Requests are sometimes not delivered because they are removed by “spam
        filters” in the IT department of the authority. Authorities can make
        sure this doesn’t happen by asking their IT departments to “whitelist”
        any email from <strong>@whatdotheyknow.com</strong>. If you <a href="<%=
        help_contact_path %>">ask us</a> we will resend any request, and/or give
        technical details of delivery so an IT department can chase up what
        happened to the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, you can respond to any request from your web browser, without
        needing any email, using the “Respond to request” link at the bottom of
        each request page.

        The Freedom of Information Act says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A public authority must comply with section 1(1)
          <strong>promptly</strong> and in any event not later than the
          twentieth working day following the date of receipt.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In our opinion, what matters most here is that the law says authorities
        must respond <strong>promptly</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a good reason why the request is going to take a while to
        process, requesters find it really helpful if you can send a quick email
        with a sentence or two saying what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        FOI officers often have to do a lot of hard work to answer requests, and
        this is hidden from the public. We think it would help everyone to have
        more of that complexity visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, our site does provide an automatic countdown to the 20
        working day deadline. Here’s how we calculate it.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If the day we deliver the request by email is a working day, we count
          that as “day zero”, even if it was delivered late in the evening. Days
          end at midnight.  We then count the next working day as “day one”, and
          so on up to <strong>20 working days</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the day the request email was delivered was a non-working day, we
          count the next working day as “day one”. Delivery is delivery, even if
          it happened on the weekend. Some authorities
          <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/policy_regarding_body_scans#incoming-1100">
          disagree with this</a>, our lawyer disagrees with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Requesters are encouraged to mark when they have
          <strong>clarified</strong> their request so the clock resets, but
          sometimes they get this wrong. If you see a problem with a particular
          request, let us know and we’ll fix it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The date thus calculated is shown on requests with the text “By law,
        Liverpool City Council should normally have responded by...”.  Schools
        are a special case, which WhatDoTheyKnow displays differently.Since June
        2009, schools have “20 working days disregarding any working day which
        is not a school day, or 60 working days, whichever is first” (<a
        href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1369/contents/made">FOI
        (Time for Compliance with Request) Regulations 2009</a>). WhatDoTheyKnow
        indicates on requests to schools that the 20 day deadline is only during
        term time, and shows them as definitely overdue after 60 working days
      </p>

        Meanwhile, remember that the law says authorities must respond
        <strong>promptly</strong>. That’s really what matters.

      How do you reflect time extensions for public interest tests?
      <a href="#public_interest_test">#</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The Freedom of Information Act allows authorities to claim an
        <strong>indefinite time extension</strong> when applying a public
        interest test. As WhatDoTheyKnow doesn’t specifically handle such
        extensions we use the phrase “should normally have responded promptly
        by” when the 20 working day time is exceeded. Once 40 working days have
        elapsed we use much stronger wording as we consider that all requests
        should have received a response by that point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1165/time-for-compliance-foia-guidance.pdf">
        Guidance from the Commissioner</a> suggests extensions beyond 40 working
        days may be acceptable in exceptional cases such as where a body is
        under extreme pressure due to a major incident or where a public
        interest test involves “exceptional levels of complexity”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act does not allow such a public
        interest extension. WhatDoTheyKnow would like to see the law changed to
        either remove the extension from the UK Act, or to reintroduce an
        absolute time limit of 40 working days even with the extension (the
        House of Lords <a
        href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2000-10-17&amp;number=1&amp;house=lords">
        voted to remove</a> provision
        for such a time limit during the initial passage of the UK Act through

          Consider if it is reasonable to split your data into a number of

          series of emails, with one attachment to each message.
        </li>
        <li>
          A plain text format may produce a smaller file size, and be easier for
          people to work with than a proprietary format.
        </li>
        <li>

        Removing email addresses also helps keep correspondence on the site. To

        address forms an important part of a response and we will post it up in
        an annotation. Our volunteer team doesn’t have the capacity to deal with
