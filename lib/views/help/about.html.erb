    <dt id="purpose">What is WhatDoTheyKnow for? <a href="#purpose">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
      To help you find out inside information about the UK Government and UK public bodies.
      The site helps people access information about central government, local government,
      Parliament, the NHS, the armed forces, state funded schools and universities and
      other public authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use the site to find out information that regulators hold about businesses,
      charities and other organisations.
    </p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
    write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
    to the public authority. Any response received is automatically published on the
    website for you and anyone else to find and read.
    </dd>
    <dt id="whybother_me">Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
    things that affect your life, from health care through to national defence. Some
    it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
    works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
    are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.
    Some people also use the site for research.
    </dd>
    <dt id="whybother_them">Why would the public authority bother to reply? <a href="#whybother_them">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>Under Freedom of Information (FOI) law, they have to respond. The response
    will either contain the information you want, or give a valid legal reason why
    it has not been provided.
    </dd>
    <dt id="useful">Does useful information get released through the site? <a href="#useful">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    Yes. Thousands of documents have been released through the site.

    <dt id="reporting">What if I see a request I feel to be inappropriate? <a href="#reporting">#</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Requests for personal information and vexatious requests are not considered valid for FOI purposes (read more).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you believe a request is not suitable, you can report it for attention by the site administrators.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="reporting_unavailable">Why won't it let me report some requests? <a href="#reporting_unavailable">#</a></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        If a request has already been reported to the site administrators, you
        can't report it a second time - this is to prevent the administrators
        being notified multiple times about the same issue before they've had
        a chance to conduct a review.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where a request has been previously reported but an administrator has
        chosen not to hide it from public view, you can use the form in the
        sidebar of the request page to contact the administrators if you still
        think it should be hidden.
