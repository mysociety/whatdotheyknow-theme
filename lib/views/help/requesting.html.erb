    <p>It can be hard to untangle the complicated structure of government,
      and work out who has the information you want. Here are a few tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Browse or <a href="<%= search_redirect_path %>">search</a>
        WhatDoTheyKnow and look for similar requests to the one you plan to
        make: which authority were they sent to, and were they successful? If
        so, it&rsquo;s probably the one you want.
      </li>

      <li>
        It&rsquo;s always worth double-checking though, so when you&rsquo;ve found an
        authority you think might have the information, use the
        &ldquo;home page&rdquo; link on the right hand side of their page to
        check their website and see exactly what their responsibilities are.
      </li>

      <li>
        You might even contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they
        hold the kind of information you&rsquo;re after.
      </li>

      <li>
        But at the end of the day, there’s no need to worry too much about
        getting the right authority. If you get it wrong, they ought to advise
        you who to make the request to instead.

        As well as providing a simple way to make Freedom of Information
        requests, WhatDoTheyKnow actively campaigns for the expansion of the scope
        of Freedom of Information law to cover a wider number of public bodies.

        Via the site, you can make requests for information to a range of
        organisations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Those formally subject to the FOI Act (as set out in Schedule One
          of the Act, as amended).
        </li>
        <li>
          Those formally subject to the Environmental Information Regulations or
          EIR (a more ambiguous group which includes bodies subject to FOI, and in
          addition a wider group of bodies with some public role such as utility
          companies. Currently the legal precedent for setting out which bodies
          are subject to EIR is the judgement in the

          Fish Legal</a> case).
        </li>
        <li>
          Public bodies which voluntarily comply with the FOI Act even though
          they are not legally obliged to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those which aren’t subject to the Act
          <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/list/foi_no">but which we
          think should be</a>, for example because they have significant public
          responsibilities. These include bodies which operate as a regulator,
          make public appointments, or distribute significant amounts of public
          funds.

    <p>
      A Freedom of Information request is just what the name implies: a request
      for information, or data. If the authority holds the data, in most cases,
      the law obliges them to release it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can speed up the process by making your request concise, clear and
      focused. Include nothing more than what is needed for the Information
      Officer to understand what information you are asking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should <i>not</i> include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        arguments about your cause
      </li>
      <li>
        statements that could defame or insult others
      </li>
      <li>
        questions or requests for comment rather than for specific information
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Freedom of Information process does not allow for general
      correspondence, background details or the rights and wrongs of a
      situation. It simply gives you the right to ask for documents or data
      that the authority holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Framing your request accordingly will get better results, so for example,
      instead of asking  “why are you doing X?” or “how do you feel about the
      results of doing X” (which makes it more likely that your message will
      not be seen as a valid FOI request, both by us and by the public authority)
      you should ask for “copies of all policies and procedures regarding X”.
      If you include extraneous material, we may have to remove your request to
      avoid problems with libel law, which is inconvenient for both you and us.

      How can I make responsible and effective FOI requests?

    <dd>
      <p>
        At WhatDoTheyKnow, we have an interest in making sure that our users’
        FOI requests are as effective as possible, because that’s better for
        everyone.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It’s better for you, because you get faster, higher quality results.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s better for the often overloaded staff who receive your requests,
          because it makes their jobs easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s better for us, because we rely on the goodwill both of our users
          and of authorities to continue operation.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s better for our rights to information as a whole, because if
          requests become too much of a burden, there’s a greater chance of
          laws being passed that restrict our access to information in the
          future.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here are the ways you can optimise your request:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Send it to the right place</strong>
          Make an effort to ensure that your request
          is directed to the appropriate body. We appreciate that’s not always
          easy, and if you’re not sure after doing some research, by all means
          make your request to the body you think is most likely to hold the
          information are seeking. You can expect them to provide advice and
          assistance to point you to the right place if you get it wrong; or if
          you get stuck you’re <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/contact">
          welcome to seek help from the WhatDoTheyKnow volunteer team</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Don’t carpet-bomb</strong>
            You might be planning to make a request to, for
            example, all local councils, or even all public bodies in the country,
            but  it’s worth stopping to reflect. Such bulk requests result in a
            lot of data, and cost a lot in staff time for the authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will you actually be able to handle that quantity of data? Consider
            if your needs could be met by requesting information from a
            representative sample of bodies, or by requesting information from
            your local council and a set of councils covering areas with similar
            characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also consider if the information may be held centrally, for example
            by a Government department, and so obtained via a single request
            rather than many.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Word your question carefully</strong>
          It can be worth specifying the format
          you’d like your response in, and making sure that you ask for exactly
          the data you need, or you may find that, when making requests to a
          range of bodies, they answer in so many different formats that you
          can’t compare like with like.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine-tune your request</strong>  Make the right request the
          first time, and you won’t have to return for further information
          later. So, consider what you want to do with the information when you
          receive it and whether you will need additional information to put the
          material in context.  For example, statistics on the numbers of
          potholes fixed by a council this year might be more useful if obtained
          with context such as the figures for previous years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>But don’t ask for too much</strong> On the flip side, one of
          the reasons that authorities can turn down a request is that it would
          take too many resources (ie staff time and financial cost) to answer
          fully — so only ask for what you need. Restricting your request to
          material from a specific time period is a responsible approach and it
          can prevent your request being rejected on the grounds of being too
          broad to deal with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay courteous</strong> The FOI officer is often the defender
          of the public’s right to information within an authority.  They may
          well be acting as your advocate within the public body, and you’ll
          find that they’re often  keen to help you. They’ll remain all the more
          so if you treat them politely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Remember it’s all going online</strong> So take care not to
          include any defamatory material in your request, such as allegations
          of illegal or abusive behaviour. Not only can such material cause
          serious problems for us, it can put you at risk of committing libel,
          and your request being deemed vexatious — in which case you won’t
          receive a response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider asking for proactive publication</strong>
          To save you from having to make a similar request again in the future
          you might want to ask the public body to consider starting to
          proactively publish the information on their website. In some cases,
          where the “datasets” provisions of Freedom of Information law apply,
          public bodies are required to publish up-to-date versions of requested
          material.

      <p>
        <strong>Making an FOI request is nearly always free.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Authorities often include standardised text in their acknowledgement
        messages saying they “may” charge a fee, which, understandably, can be a
        little frightening. Ignore such notices. They hardly ever will actually
        charge a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the activities that authorities can charge for, such as
        photocopying, and postage, don’t usually apply to requests made via
        WhatDoTheyKnow, which are all conducted via email. Additionally, a
        public body  can only charge you if you have specifically agreed in
        advance to pay. See <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/receiving-a-request/#15">more details</a>
        from the Information Commissioner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes an authority will refuse your request, saying that the cost to
        them of handling it exceeds <a
        href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/3244/made"> the limits</a>
        of £600 (for central government) or £450 (for all other public
        authorities).  At this point you could choose to refine your request:
        for example, it would be much cheaper for an authority to tell you the
        amount spent on advertising in the past year than in the past ten years.

      Will I get the information in the format I want?
      <a href="#format">#</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The law requires that if you ask for the information to be provided in a
        particular format the public authority is required to do so,  so long as
        it is as reasonably practicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might want to explicitly request data in a reusable format such as a
        .csv file (which you can import into spreadsheet software); this helps
        prevent the response being provided as  images, or screenshots of
        spreadsheets which are much harder to extract data from.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no need to explicitly request a response ‘via email’, though: we
        consider that by making your request via WhatDoTheyKnow, you are already
        making this clear.

      <p>
        By law, public authorities must respond <i>“promptly”</i> to requests.
        We interpret this to mean that you should expect a response as soon as
        is practical for the authority in question, taking into consideration
        factors such as the quantity of information you have requested, the
        authority’s workload from other requests, and the staff available to
        deal with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case,  the law states that they must respond within 20 working
        days, with a couple of exceptions: if you had to clarify your request,
        or your request is to  a school, or in one or two other scenarios, then
        they may have more time — <a
        href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/officers#days">you can read
        more about timescales here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        WhatDoTheyKnow will automatically send you an email reminder if you don’t
        get a response  within the time limit. You can then send the public
        authority a message to chase your request, and tell them if they are
        breaking the law.

      There are several things you can do if your request goes unanswered.

        First, check it went through.  If you see <a

        a little green tick</a> on your request page, you can
        be sure that your request went through smoothly from our end and has
        been received by the authority’s mail server. Nonetheless, there can
        sometimes be a hitch at the other end, so it is worth telephoning the
        authority and politely checking that they received your request. Quote
        any reference number that may have been included in an auto-response.
        They may also ask what format your request was sent in: all
        WhatDoTheyKnow requests are sent by  email.
      </li>
      <li>
        If it went through, follow up. Use the “Write a reply” option under
        “Actions” on your request, to request an acknowledgement of your request
        if one isn’t forthcoming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If they have not received it,</strong> the problem is most
        likely due to “spam filters”. Refer the authority to the measures in the
        answer &lsquo;<a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor =>

        should use the “Report this request” option under “Actions” to alert the
        volunteer support team to the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If you&rsquo;re still having no luck,</strong>then you can first
        ask for an internal review, and then complain to the Information
        Commissioner about the authority. If you get no response at all then you
        can ask the ICO for help without waiting for an internal review. Read

      Information Regulations 2005</a>”, which at first glance implies you may not
      be able do anything with the information. They also sometimes put copyright
      notices on material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Careful scrutiny of the legislation, however, shows that you are at
      liberty to  write articles about the information, summarise it, or quote
      parts of it.  It’s WhatDoTheyKnow’s belief that  you should feel free to
      republish the information in full, just as we do, even though in theory
      you might not be allowed to do so: <a href="<%= help_officers_path(:anchor => 'copyright') %>">
      our policy on copyright</a> explains why.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the information you have received is Crown Copyright then you are able to
      reproduce it under the
      <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/government-licensing/about-the-ogl.htm">Open
      Government Licence</a> but there are some conditions — check that link for

      No. The correct channel for requesting any information that a public
      authority holds about you is via a Subject Access request using the Data
      Protection law.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website does not allow for such requests, not least because we
      publish correspondence online, where anyone would be able to see the
      potentially sensitive information that can result from such requests.
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/personal-information/">The

      Subject Access request.

        WhatDoTheyKnow is currently only designed for public requests. All
        responses that we receive are automatically published on the website for
        anyone to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, WhatDoTheyKnow<sup>Pro</sup> is a service for journalists and
        campaigners which includes the ability to delay publication of your
        requests and responses. If you are a journalist, campaigner, activist,
        or someone else with a need to make requests for information which are,
        at least initially, private then <a href="<%= account_request_index_path %>">

      <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body?tag=eir_only">Some public

      Milford Haven Port Authority</a>, don&rsquo;t
      come under the Freedom of Information Act, but do come under another law
      called the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR).
    </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a very similar law, so you make a request
      to them using WhatDoTheyKnow in just the same way as an FOI request. The only
      difference is that on the page where your write you request, it reminds you
      that you can only request &ldquo;environmental information&rdquo; and tells you what that
      means. It is quite broad.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can, of course, request environmental information from other
      authorities. Just make a Freedom of Information (FOI) request as normal. The
      authority has a duty to work out if the Environmental Information Regulations
      (EIR) is the more appropriate legislation to reply under.

      <a href="#multiple">#</a>

      <p>
        This is possible, under certain circumstances. We urge those considering
        making requests to large numbers of bodies to carefully consider if
        doing so is justified. Thought should be given to the potential cost to
        the public sector, the reputation of Freedom of Information and
        WhatDoTheyKnow.com as well as the potential benefits of having the
        information released.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are sure that your requests are valid and defensible, we ask
        you to first send a test version to a few authorities. Their responses
        will help you improve the wording of your request, so that you get the
        best information when you go on to send it to the remaining authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is currently no automated system for sending the request to
        multiple authorities: you must copy and paste it by hand, although, see
        below for details of our forthcoming service WhatDoTheyKnow
        Professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some automated restrictions on the number of requests that can
        be sent through WhatDoTheyKnow at a time. These are for spam prevention
        and can be overridden on request. Before removing restrictions on
        accounts the team may make suggestions aimed at improving the requests,
        and checking information isn’t already published, or hasn’t already been
        collated centrally, and can’t be obtained by a request to just one body.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a journalist, activist, campaigner or someone else who would
        find it useful to have  a tool enabling you to make requests to multiple
        bodies at the same time please <a href="<%= account_request_index_path
        %>"> find out more and get in touch</a>.

      <p>
        WhatDoTheyKnow is an archive of requests made through the site, and does

      </p>
      <p>
        For that reason, we don’t  provide a means by which to upload requests
        that were made by other means, and we have no plans to do so in the
        future. The main reason for this is that we can’t verify that responses
        received from outside our system actually came from the authority they
        purport to — and we are keen to ensure that all content on
        WhatDoTheyKnow is 100% verifiable.

      <p>
        It is exceptionally rare that a Freedom of Information request requires
        an attached document, so we don’t offer this functionality. If
        necessary, you can upload material to other services such as flickr.com,
        Google Docs, or scribd.com and then provide a link in the body of your
        request.  Where a location on map is required as part of a request, many
        online mapping services, such as Google Maps, allow you to share exact
        co-ordinates via a link.

        If you work for a public body and you know of  information that the
        public should have access to, making a Freedom of Information request
        via WhatDoTheyKnow can be a good way to get it into the public domain.
        We’re happy for people to use our service under a pseudonym (although
        you should first read <a
        href="<%= help_privacy_path(:anchor => 'real_names') %>">our advice
        on using pseudonyms</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Whistleblowers keen to keep their identity secret should take
        precautions such as not making their request from their workplace, and
        not using their work email address (it’s possible a court may order us
        to release user information we hold). Using a pre-paid mobile phone
        rather than an internet connection at home, or even drafting a request
        for someone else to send might be worth considering.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may wish to consider setting up a new account for your
        whistleblowing request as your history of requests may help people identify you.

    <dd>
      <p>
        Annotations on WhatDoTheyKnow have a specific purpose: they are provided
        so that the site’s community of users can help people get the
        information they want, or, once they’ve received it, give them advice
        about the next steps they might take. We reserve the right to remove
        annotations that don’t fit into one of these categories. Please see our
        <a href="<%= help_how_path %>">‘How we run
        WhatDoTheyKnow’</a> section for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Political discussions and personal opinions are not allowed in
        annotations: if you feel strongly that you need to provide background
        context, you may post a link to a suitable forum, blog post or campaign
        site elsewhere. Please see our <a href="<%= help_house_rules_path
        %>">House Rules</a> section for more information about the standards we
        expect our users to adhere to.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to keep our service tightly focused on its purpose, and with
        limited administrative resources, we prioritise substantive FOI requests
        and responses. For that reason we spend less time on the moderation of
        annotations than of FOI correspondence, and the threshold for removal of
        annotations is relatively low.
