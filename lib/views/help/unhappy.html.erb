    If you <strong>didn’t get a response to your request within 20 working days</strong> you can:
  </p>

  <ul>

      Refer your request to the
      <a href="#refer-to-ico">Information Commissioner</a>.
    </li>

  <p>
    If you <strong>did not get all of the information</strong> that you
    requested, or your request was <strong>refused without a reason</strong>
    valid under the law you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask for an <a href="#internal_review">internal review</a> at the public
      authority.
    </li>

    <li>
      If that doesn't help, you can refer the request to the

      Choose <%= link_to "request an internal review", new_request_followup_url(
        @info_request.url_title, anchor: 'followup', internal_review: 1
      ) %> and then write a
      message asking the authority to review your request.
    <% else %>
      At the bottom of the relevant request page on WhatDoTheyKnow choose
      "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
      review of your request. You should be as specific as possible about the reasons 
      you are unhappy with the way your request was handled. It may be helpful to include
      a link to the request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about. 
    <% end %>
  </summary>

  <p>
    You don't need to ask for an internal review if the authority hasn't
    responded to your request at all by the deadline. You can go straight to
    the Information Commissioner.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a good chance an internal review will prompt a change in the public
    body's stance. Based on Scottish data, 
    <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/html/reforming-foi/l/7.62.67c3q.zdv8i.j1tkf.dejgi.html">
    16% of internal reviews</a> result in an entirely substituted decision (and more a partially substituted decision)
    , and based on UK central government data roughly 
    <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/html/reforming-foi/l/7.62.67c3q.zdv8i.j1tkf.dejgi.html">
    25% of internal reviews</a> lead to more information being released.
  </p>

  <p>Internal reviews should be quick. If one takes longer than 20 working days
    then the authority should write and let you know, and it should never take
    longer than 40 working days (see this
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/refusing-a-request/#20">good practice guide</a>).
    You will then either get the information that
    you originally requested, or you will be told that the review upholds the
    original decision.

<h2 id="refer-to-ico">2. Referring a request to the Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#refer-to-ico">#</a></h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    If the authority hasn't <%= link_to 'responded to your request at all',
    help_no_response_path %> after 20 working days, you can complain straight
    to the Information Commissioner without needing to request an internal
    review. If the public authority has done their internal review and you
    are unhappy with their response, or if the public authority has refused
    to carry out an internal review, you can refer your request to the
    Information Commissioner.
  </summary>

  <p>
    To make a referral,
    start by reading <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/foi-and-eir-complaints/foi-and-eir-complaints/">the
    Information Commissioner's advice for those with concerns about accessing
    information</a>, which links to their form. If you requested information
    from a Scottish authority, then you should contact
    <a href="https://www.foi.scot/appeal">the
    Scottish Information Commissioner</a> instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the Information Commissioner suggests that you fill out their form 
    and attach any supporting evidence, in practice they also consider referrals 
    made via email, to <strong><code>
    <a href="mailto:ICOCasework@ico.org.uk?subject=FOI%2FEIR%20Complaint">
    icocasework@ico.org.uk</a></code></strong>, and accept a link to your request 
    on WhatDoTheyKnow.com as evidence of the correspondence related to the request
    You should clearly explain what part of the response you wish to challenge and why. 
    For example, if you think that the authority has not fully considered all of the public 
    interest arguments in favour of releasing the information, or if you disagree with how
    they have applied a particular exemption, you should state this.
    If you wish to download copies of correspondence, and attachments, to
    send to the Information Commissioner the <code>.zip</code> download
    feature, accessed via "Actions" may assist.
  </p>

  <p>
    WhatDoTheyKnow does not currently have any special facilities for handling a
    referral to the Information Commissioner. We encourage users to leave
    annotations on requests keeping people informed of progress.
    <a href="https://icosearch.ico.org.uk/s/search.html?collection=ico-meta&profile=decisions&query">
    Decisions by the Information Commissioner are published online</a> and you
    can link to a decision via an annotation on the request.
  </p>

  <p>
    A warning. Although the Information Commissioner has worked hard to reduce
    their backlog of casework, it can still take several months to get
    resolution from them in many cases. One area where they have sped up things
    considerably is that they are able to prompt non-responsive authorities to
    reply within a few weeks of receiving a complaint.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are unhappy with the response from the Information Commissioner's
    office you can ask them to reconsider it under their
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/complaints-and-compliments-about-us/complain-about-us/">
    complaints process</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you reach the point of referring a case to the Information Commissioner,
    you should accept that you won't get the information quickly by this means.
    Maybe you want to help the fight to improve our Freedom of Information
    regime, or maybe getting the information slowly is still worthwhile. You
    can also try and get the information by other means…

<details>
  <summary>
    You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways.
  </summary>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Make a <strong>new FOI request</strong> for summary information, or for
      documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
      <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.
    </li>

    <li>
      If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned
      companies are involved, then make FOI requests to them.
    </li>

    <li>
      Write to <strong>your MP</strong> or other politician using <a
      href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a> and ask for their help
      finding the answer. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments,
      and can ask written questions in the House of Commons. Councillors in
      local authorities can talk directly to council officers.
    </li>

    <li>
      Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
      issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this
      site; contact any registered user from their page. There may be an
      Internet forum or group that they hang out in.
    </li>

    <li>
      You could form a small local campaign group and arrange a meeting
      with staff from the authority.
