    If you <strong>didn’t get a reply within 20 working days</strong> you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Refer your request to the
      <a href="#refer-to-ico">Information Commissioner</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you <strong>did not get all of the information</strong> that you
    requested, or your request was <strong>refused without a reason</strong>
    valid under the law you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask for an <a href="#internal_review">internal review</a> at the public
      authority. If that doesn't help, you can refer the request to the
      <a href="#refer-to-ico">Information Commissioner</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="<%= select_authority_path %>">Make a new request</a> asking for
      more specific information or to a more appropriate authority

<p>
  <% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    <% path = new_request_followup_url(request_id: @info_request.id) +
              "?internal_review=1#followup" %>

    Choose <%= link_to "request an internal review", path %> and then write a
    message asking the authority to review your request.
  <% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on WhatDoTheyKnow choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.
  <% end %>
</p>
<p>
  You don't need to ask for an internal review if the authority haven't responded
  to your request at all by the deadline. You can go straight to the Information
  Commissioner.
</p>
<p>Internal reviews should be quick. If one takes longer than 20 working days
  then the authority should write and let you know, and it should never take
  longer than 40 working days (see this
  <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/refusing-a-request/#20">good practice guide</a>).
  You will then either get the information that
  you originally requested, or you will be told that the review upholds the
  original decision.

<h2 id="refer-to-ico">2. Referring a request to the Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#refer-to-ico">#</a></h2>
<p>
  If you are still unhappy after the public authority has done their internal
  review, then you can refer your request to the Information Commissioner, who
  is empowered to uphold access to information laws. To make a referral,
  start by reading <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/getting/">the
  Information Commissioner's advice for those with concerns about accessing
  information</a> which links to their form. If you requested information from a
  Scottish authority, then it is
  <a href="http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/YourRights/YourRights.asp">the
  Scottish Information Commissioner</a> who you will need to contact.
</p>

<p>
  While the Information Commissioner asks for their form to be completed and
  evidence supporting a referral to be attached in practice we are aware they
  routinely consider referrals made via a simple email setting out the issues,
  containing a link to the request on WhatDoTheyKnow.com to provide evidence of
  the full history of the correspondence related to the request. If you do wish
  to download copies of correspondence, and attachments, to send to the
  Information Commissioner the <code>.zip</code> download feature, accessed via
  "Actions" may assist.
</p>

<p>
  WhatDoTheyKnow does not currently have any special facilities for handling a
  referral to the Information Commissioner. We encourage users to leave
  annotations on requests keeping people informed of progress.
  <a href="https://icosearch.ico.org.uk/s/search.html?collection=ico-meta&profile=decisions&query">
  Decisions by the Information Commissioner are published online</a> and you can
  link to a decision via an annotation on the request.
</p>

<p>
  A warning. Although the Information Commissioner has worked hard to reduce
  their backlog of casework, it can still take several months to get resolution
  from them in many cases. One area where they have sped up things considerably
  is that they are able to prompt non-responsive authorities to reply within a
  few weeks of receiving a complaint.
</p>

<p>
  If you are unhappy with the response from the Information Commissioner's
  office you can ask them to reconsider it under their
  <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/complaints-and-compliments-about-us/complain-about-us/">
  complaints process</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you reach the point of referring a case to the Information Commissioner,
  you should accept that you won't get the information quickly by this means.
  Maybe you want to help the fight to improve our Freedom of Information regime,
  or maybe getting the information slowly is still worthwhile. You can also try
  and get the information by other means…
</p>

<h2 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h2>
<p>You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a <strong>new FOI request</strong> for summary information, or for
    documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
    <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
    <li>If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,
    then make FOI requests to them.</li>
    <li>Write to <strong>your MP</strong> or other politician using <a
    href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a> and ask for their help
    finding the answer. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments, and
    can ask written questions in the House of Commons. Councillors in local authorities
  can talk directly to council officers.</li>
  <% if can_ask_the_eu?(@country_code) %>
  <li>
    Try <%= link_to 'asking for the information from the European Union',
    'http://www.asktheeu.org' %>. Every one of the 500 million people
    living in the European Union (both citizens and residents) has the
    legally guaranteed right to ask for information from EU authorities.
    <%= link_to 'AskTheEU.org', 'http://www.asktheeu.org' %> is a version of
    this website for the European Union.
  </li>
  <% end %>
  <li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
    issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this site;
    contact any registered user from their page. There may be an Internet
  forum or group that they hang out in. </li>
  <li>You could form a small local campaign group and arrange a meeting
  with staff from the authority.</li>
