<p>... you can</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask for an <strong>internal review</strong> at the public authority.</li>
<li>If that doesn't help, complain to the <strong>Information Commissioner</strong>.</li>
<li>Either way, also <strong>use other means</strong> to answer your question.</li>

<h1 id="internal_review">1. Asking for an internal review <a class="hover_a" href="#internal_review">#</a> </h1>

<p>
<% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    Choose <%= link_to "request an internal review", new_request_followup_url(:request_id => @info_request.id) + "?internal_review=1#followup" %> and then write a message asking the authority to review your request.
<% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on WhatDoTheyKnow choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.
<% end %>
</p>

<p>Internal reviews should be quick. If one takes longer than 20 working days
then the authority should write and let you know, and it should never take
longer than 40 working days (see this
<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/refusing-a-request/#20">good practice guide</a>).
You will then either get the information that
you originally requested, or you will be told that the review upholds the
original decision.
</p>

<h1 id="complaining">2. Complaining to the Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#complaining">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the public authority has done their internal review,
then you can complain to the Information Commissioner. To do this, read
<a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/getting/">the Information Commissioner's advice for those with concerns about accessing information</a>. If you requested information from a Scottish
authority, then  <a href="http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/YourRights/YourRights.asp">appeal
to the Scottish Information Commissioner</a>.
</p>

<p>To make it easier to send the relevant information to the
Information Commissioner, either
<% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    include a link to your request
    <strong><%= request_url(@info_request) %></strong>
<% else %>
    include a link to your request on WhatDoTheyKnow
<% end %>
in your complaint or print out the whole page of your request and all attachments.
</p>

<p>WhatDoTheyKnow has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
passes into the Information Commissioner's system. You can leave annotations on your
request keeping people informed of progress.</p>

<p>A warning. Although the Information Commissioner has worked hard to reduce their backlog of casework,
it can still take several months to get resolution from them in most circumstances.
One area where they have sped up things considerably is that they are able to prompt non-responsive
authorities to reply within a few weeks of receiving a complaint.</p>

<p>If you reach this point, you should accept that you won't get the information quickly by this means. Maybe
you want to help the fight to improve Freedom of Information, or maybe
getting the information slowly is still worthwhile. You can also try and
get the information by <strong>other means...</strong></p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways.

<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>new FOI request</strong> for summary information, or for
documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
<a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
<li>If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,

then make FOI requests to them.</li>
<li>Write to <strong>your MP</strong> or other politician using <a
href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a> and ask for their help
finding the answer. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments, and
can ask written questions in the House of Commons. Councillors in local authorities
can talk directly to council officers.</li>

contact any registered user from their page. There may be an Internet
forum or group that they hang out in. </li>
<li>You could form a small local campaign group and arrange a meeting
with staff from the authority.</li>
