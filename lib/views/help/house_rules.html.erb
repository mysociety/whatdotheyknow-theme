  <h2> How we expect people to use and behave on the site </h2>
  <p>
    Violation of any of the below rules is likely to lead to the suspension of
    your account, and you will no longer be able to make requests or updates on
    WhatDoTheyKnow.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, breaking these rules could lead to legal action being taken
    against you by the authorities or an aggrieved party.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, breaches often take significant amounts of volunteer time to
    deal with and risk mySociety’s ability to run the service.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use WhatDoTheyKnow only to request specific information, not for general
      correspondence with public authorities, and certainly not for personal
      correspondence.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not include potentially defamatory/potential libellous comments (such
      as allegations) in your requests and annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not post information that is unlawful, harassing, defamatory, abusive,
      threatening, harmful, obscene, discriminatory or profane
    </li>
    <li>
      Only use WhatDoTheyKnow.com to request information which anyone could
      expect to obtain if they requested it. If you have a specific right to
      information, for example because you are seeking your own personal 
      information, then you should correspond privately with the public body
      concerned to request it. Requests for your own personal information are
      known as Subject Access requests and
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-to-get-copies-of-your-data/"
      title="Guidance from the Information Commissioner on your right of access">
      the Information Commissioner has published advice on making such requests</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep messages sent via our service concise and tightly focused on the
      subject of the request for information. Heed our
      <%= link_to help_requesting_path(anchor: 'responsible') do -%>
        advice on making responsible and effective requests.
      <% end %>
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not try to impersonate someone else.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not use any language likely to offend in your requests and annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
      No spamming.
    </li>
    <li>
      Requests must be made in mixed case letters, i.e. not all in capitals and
      not all in lowercase (this is automatically enforced by the software that
      WhatDoTheyKnow runs on).
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not make vexatious requests (requests with no serious purpose, or which
      are intended to disrupt the operation of a public body). The ICO has
      guidance on vexatious requests
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1198/dealing-with-vexatious-requests.pdf">
      here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not use our service to request other people’s personal information and 
      do not include such information in requests, annotations or follow-ups, 
      unless it is fair to do so.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not seek to evade the actions of site administrators by, for example,
      creating new accounts to evade a ban, or a rate-limiting cap, or by
      republishing material which you know has been removed by moderators.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By breaking the rules above, you risk being banned from using the site,
    and/or your requests/annotations being removed.  In cases where it’s clear
    that your intentions are not malicious, we will contact you first so that we
    can give advice on how better to use the service.
