  <!-- We have not added all of the tags that are needed to make this a valid HTML file yet.-->
  <p>Perhaps ironically, the field of freedom of information has developed its own jargon that may not be accessible to everyone. Here is an  attempt to explain some of the abbreviations and special terms used by FOI officers and transparency campaigners.
This glossary also seeks to explain some of terms used in our help pages. </p>

<dt>Aarhus Convention</dt>
<dd>The Aarhus Convention provides a right of access to environmental information. The Convention was signed in June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus.

<dt>API</dt>
<dd>API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is as a piece of software that allows two computer programmes to exchange information. See also: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/help/api</d>

<dt>Applicant blind</dt>
<dd>The principle that the information released in response to an [[#EIR|EIR]] or [[#FOI|FOI]] request should be the same no matter who the requester is. In practice, public authorities can take the identity of the requester into account in certain situations e.g. when applying the cost limit.</dd>

<dd>Categorisation game</dd>
<dt>WhatDoTheyKnow encourages users to classify their requests to indicate whether they were successful or not.  Any requests that are not classified by the user will after a period of time become available for any other user to classify. Classifying requests earns points in the categorisation game. See also: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/categorise/play</dt>

<dt>Cost limit</dt>
<dd>Public authorities can refuse to answer FOI requests where the estimated cost of compliance exceeds the appropriate limit which is known as the cost limit. The cost limit is currently £600 for central government and £450 for all other public authorities. See also the ICO guidance document <a href=”https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1199/costs_of_compliance_exceeds_appropriate_limit.pdf”>Requests where the cost of compliance exceeds the appropriate limit</a>.

In Scotland, most authorities will be responding under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act, which sets a cost limit of £600. This is set out in the Freedom of Information (Fees for Required Disclosure) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 ([https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2004/467/contents/made SSI 2004 no. 467]). There is more information in the Scottish Information Commissioner's guidance document - [https://www.itspublicknowledge.info/sites/default/files/2022-03/FeesandExcessiveCostofComplianceBriefing.pdf Charging a fee or refusing to comply with a request on excessive cost grounds] - which also explains the circumstances in which a public authority might occasionally issue a "fees notice".</dd>
