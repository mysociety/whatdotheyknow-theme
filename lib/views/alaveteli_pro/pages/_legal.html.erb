    <li>
      You will still be able to see any requests which are currently private,

    These Terms are subject to the law of England and Wales. They constitute all
    the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and mySociety and supersede
    any prior agreements, whether written or oral.
  </p>
  <p>
    You expressly understand and agree that to the maximum extent permitted by
    law mySociety excludes all liability and responsibility to you for any loss
    or damage resulting, directly or indirectly, from your use of or inability
    to use WhatDoTheyKnow Pro. In any event, our total liability for all claims
    made about WhatDoTheyKnow Pro in any month will be no more than what you
    paid us for the Service the month before.
  </p>
  <p>
    mySociety shall not be deemed to have waived its right to enforce any of its
    rights under this agreement merely because it has previously failed to
    enforce its rights under this agreement, or permitted you to breach any term
    of this agreement on one or more occasions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a court, or other competent authority, finds that any term of this
    agreement is illegal or otherwise unenforceable, that term is to be treated
    as if it had been severed from this agreement. Its severance will be treated
    (as far as possible) as having no effect on the remainder of this agreement.
