      <p>
        We understand that it can be difficult to get a response from the Home
        Office to personal immigration queries. We suggest writing to the Home
        Office via a local Member of Parliament, if you <a
        href="http://www.writetothem.com/">send your correspondence to your MP
        </a>, they or their office, can pass it on to the Home Office and ensure
        you get a response. This has the benefit of highlighting difficulties
        communicating with the Home Office to MPs.
      </p>
      <p>
      You could also try contacting the Home Office by email at: <a
      href="mailto:public.enquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk">public.enquiries@
      homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Misusing our service, <strong>which makes all correspondence
        public</strong>,won't help you pursue your individual case as the Home
        Office will not enter into correspondence about individual cases via our
        service.
